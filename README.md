# NIS
Network and Information Security (NIS) focuses on protecting digital data, communication systems, and network infrastructures from unauthorized access, misuse, disruption, and attacks. As organizations increasingly rely on interconnected systems, safeguarding confidentiality, integrity, and availability has become essential. NIS encompasses a range of security mechanisms such as cryptography, authentication, intrusion detection, firewalls, and secure communication protocols. It also addresses modern threats including malware, phishing, data breaches, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This study highlights key security principles, explores common vulnerabilities, and evaluates strategies for building resilient and secure network environments. Effective implementation of NIS not only ensures secure data handling but also strengthens trust, reliability, and continuity in digital operations.
# MEDICINAL PLANTS
Medicinal plants have been used for centuries as a primary source of healthcare and continue to play a crucial role in modern medicine. They contain bioactive compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenolics, which exhibit therapeutic properties including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer effects. The growing interest in plant-based remedies is driven by their effectiveness, affordability, and fewer side effects compared to synthetic drugs. This study explores the importance of medicinal plants, their pharmacological properties, traditional applications, and their potential in the development of new drugs. It also highlights the need for conservation, proper scientific validation, and sustainable utilization to preserve medicinal plant diversity for future generations. Overall, medicinal plants remain an indispensable component of global healthcare systems and pharmaceutical research.
